                        <p>
                            Golden-brown in color, flaky and layered, paratha is a type of Indian bread that is typically consumed for breakfast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The name comes from a combination of words parat and atta (flour), referring to the cooked, layered dough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It consists of whole wheat flour that is baked in ghee (Indian clarified butter) and comes in round, triangular, square, or heptagonal shapes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Parathas are often stuffed with ingredients such as boiled potatoes, cauliflower, garlic, ginger, chili, paneer, or radish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They are sometimes accompanied by pickles, yogurt, homemade chutneys, or meat and vegetable curries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Punjab, paratha is traditionally paired with lassi, a popular yogurt-based drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the flatbread originated in Peshawar, Pakistan, it has spread throughout India where it can be found at numerous street stands and roadside eateries.
                        </p>
                            The southern Indian version is called parotta. Another way of eating paratha is to roll it into a pipe and dip it into tea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Versatile, buttery, and aromatic - parathas are irresistible in the morning, and that just may be the key to their popularity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Palak paneer is a popular Indian vegetarian dish made with paneer cheese in a rich, thick sauce consisting of pur√©ed spinach mixed with tomatoes, garam masala, garlic, and numerous spices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key ingredients are even mentioned in the name of the dish, since palak means spinach in hindi, and paneer refers to the cheese.
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            Palak paneer has roots in the Punjabi region, but there are also other variations of the dish throughout India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a highly nutritious meal that can be consumed either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, accompanied by rice or Indian flatbreads such as naan and roti.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Paratha also served with

                        <h3 class="text-center">Keema and Chicken 65</h3>
                        <p>
                            Keema is a stew that is usually prepared as a curry with ingredients such as minced lamb or goat meat, green peas, potatoes, ginger, chili, onions, ghee, garlic, and garam masala spices. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The name of the dish means minced meat in Urdu. Although keema is most popular in north India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, some believe that the dish has Persian origins due to the fact that it was first mentioned as a recipe in Ain-I-Akbari (a document about emperor Akbar's empire).
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Keema is commonly served as a main dish, accompanied by pav buns or naan and other flatbreads. It can also be used as a filling for samosas and parathas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chicken 65 is a classic poultry dish with origins in Chennai, India. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It consists of deep-fried chicken that is marinated in ginger, lemon, red chiles, and a variety of other spices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a few theories about the origin of chicken 65. The most popular theory says that it was created in Tamil Nadu by A. M. Buhari in 1965.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another one says that the original dish was made with 65 hot chili peppers, as a testament of manliness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are also some unlikely theories, such as the one claiming that the chicken was cut into 65 pieces, or that the chicken was 65 days old when the dish was prepared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to the dish's popularity, there are numerous variations, and each South Indian state has its own version.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Karnataka, the dish is garnished with grated coconut, and in Andhra Pradesh, the chicken is cooked instead of fried. Chicken 65 is commonly served with hot, red chutneys.

                        <h3 class="text-center">Rumali roti with Saag paneer</h3>
                            <p>
                                Rumali roti is a popular Indian flatbread made with white and wheat flour, water, and oil.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 The dough is baked on a traditional tawa, and since it is extremely thin, it was named handkerchief (rumali) bread.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 Some say that the bread got its name because it was used instead of a handkerchief after a meal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rumali roti is typically served as an accompaniment to various curries or with any sort of liquid meal that can be scooped up with the flatbread.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important to serve the bread slightly moist so that it does not become stiff and unpalatable. Although it has origins in the Mughal cuisine, today it is mainly consumed in North India and Pakistan.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Indian saag paneer is a famous vegetable curry which incorporates diced paneer cheese doused in a creamy mixture of fresh leafy greens, also known under the name saag.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is typically made with mustard, fenugreek, spinach, bathua, or collard greens, mashed and incorporated with tomatoes and a rich spice blend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In India, the saag mixture is believed to have originated in the Punjabi region, and paneer version is just one of many varieties which incorporates this fragrant curry base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It can be enjoyed as a smaller side dish or a nutritious main meal that is usually accompanied by rumali roti or naan.
                            </p>
